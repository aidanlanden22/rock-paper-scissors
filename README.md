# rock-paper-scissors
A simple rock paper scissors game written in html and javascript.  This program was written as part of The Odin Project javascript tutorial.  The player competes against the computer in a best of five match.  The computer's moves are randomly generated.

## Playing the Game
The game can be played by opening the html file in any popular browser.  A valid move (i.e. rock, paper, or scissors) should be entered in the browser prompt.  

## Learnings
As this was a learning excercise, its important to reflect on what was learned while working on the project:
- How to use javascript Object, specfically as a key-value dictionary
- There is no integer type in javascript, but the Math.floor() util can be used to convert a float to an int.
- window.alert is used to show the user pop-up messages in the browser. This is a frustrating user experience and hopefully more suitable alternatives will be learned soon
